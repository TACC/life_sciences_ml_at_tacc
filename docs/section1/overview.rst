HPC Systems at TACC
===================

Welcome to the Life Sciences Machine Learning @ TACC Institute!                                                       

This section will teach you about TACC computational resources.

We will cover:

* High Performance Computing systems at TACC
* connecting to the machines
* executing jobs utilizing an idev session for interactive work
* launching jobs with a Slurm job submission file
* executing basic job management tasks (e.g. job submission, cancellation, and monitoring)
* transferring files to and from the system
* the process of requesting an allocation

The program is designed for people who have little to no experience with a command line interface, but intend
to use a Linux workstation or HPC cluster.

In this unit we introduce the computational resources and software environments that will be used
throughout the workshop. Concepts covered will include the Linux command line interface, TACC
high performance computing systems, Jupyter notebooks, basic Python, and exploratory data analysis.
Mastery of these concepts is essential for successful completion of the hands-on exercises to come.

TACC Machine Learning for Life Sciences 
=======================================
Welcome to the Life Sciences Machine Learning @ TACC Institute!                                                       

Overview
^^^^^^^^
This section will teach you about TACC computational resources and how to utilizing them effectively.

* the process of requesting an allocation
* connecting to the machines
* transferring files to and from the system
* utilizing an idev session for interactive work
* understanding Slurm job submission files
* executing basic job management tasks (e.g. job submission, cancellation, and monitoring)

The program is designed for people who have little to no experience with a command line interface, but intend
to use a Linux workstation or HPC cluster.

HPC Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^
The training will be fully interactive. Participants are **strongly encouraged** to follow along on the command line.

In this workshop, we will use:

.. code-block:: console

   [local]$

for commands on the local system and:

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ 

   [vista]$
   
for commands on the remote system consistently throughout.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
To participate in this workshop, you will need a TACC account and must have set up multi-factor authentication using a token app or SMS. 
You can do this by visiting the `TACC portal <https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/dashboard/>`_, logging in, clicking on your username at the top right of the page, 
selecting "Manage Account", and, under MFA Pairing, clicking to pair. You can find more details about MFA Pairing `here <https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/mfa/>`_.

In your **TACC portal**, you can also view your allocations, open tickets, and the systems along with their current status.

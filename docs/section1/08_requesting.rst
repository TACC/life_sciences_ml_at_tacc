Requesting an Allocation
========================

To access a resource, Principal Investigators (PIs) must request an allocation.
Faculty, professional research staff, and postdoctoral researchers may request PI eligibility for their account. 
PIs are responsible for requesting resource allocations and managing their team.

Browse the `System List <https://tacc.utexas.edu/systems/all/>`_, `Allocations <https://tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/allocations/>`_, and `Software List <https://tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/software-list/>`_ to help determine which resource and allocation fits your research.

Allocation Opportunities 
------------------------

TACC offers three types of project allocations:

* Startup: These projects aim to provide the PI with an initial allocation to build a case for a Research or Educational project. Startup projects usually receive **small allocations with short durations**. This allocation may be requested to gather benchmark data for a larger allocation request, or to test the suitability of the system for a particular research project. 

* Educational: Allocations for educational projects support academic classes, with limitations on allocation sizes and availability only on specific TACC resources.

* Research: Allocations for research projects support the computational needs of the scientific community. Research project allocations **begin on calendar quarters**, are normally for one year, and must be renewed annually for multi-year projects. Requests for new research allocations and renewals **must be submitted 30 days prior to the start of the allocation period**. Requests submitted after the due date will be considered for the next allocation period.  PIs can apply for startup project allocations until the next research project quarterly deadline.

+--------------------------+-------------------------+
| Allocation Period        | New/Renewal Request Due |

| January 1 - Dec 31       | December 1              |
+--------------------------+-------------------------+
| April 1 - March 31       | March 1                 |

   ========= ===================== ================================================================================== ==================================================================================

When applying for an allocation on an HPC or Visualization system, you will be asked to estimate the number of service units (SUs) you will require for the project. SUs are calculated based on the wall-clock time of your jobs (measured in hours) and the number of nodes, depending on the system, used to run a job. Each job run on the resource consumes the SUs allocated to a project.

All the TACC resources listed below calculate Service Units (SUs) in terms of node-hours. Specialty nodes, such as GPU's, may be charged an additional multiplier.

**SUs charged = (Number of nodes) X (job wall-clock time) X (multiplier).**

A resource justification document will be required when applying for resources. The document should be in PDF form and include a description of the research being conducted and how TACC computation resources will impact this research. It should also describe the scientific applications to be used, and an estimated plan or table justifying the number of node-hours being requested.

The `TACC Resource Allocation System (TxRAS) <https://submit-tacc.xras.org/>`_ is for researchers from UT Austin, UT System and TACC Partner Institutions to request allocations. 
`ACCESS <https://allocations.access-ci.org/>`_ is for all other US academic researchers. To access Frontera, please read the `Frontera Allocations Guidelines <https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/allocations/>`_.

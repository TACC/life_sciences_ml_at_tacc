Hands-on Deep Learning
======================

In this unit we introduce the field of Deep Learning (DL). We will gain hands on experience with
key DL concepts, including neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.
We will also explore the use of DL in life science applications, including image classification and
natural language processing.

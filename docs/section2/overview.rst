Hands-on Machine Learning
=========================

In this unit we introduce the field of Machine Learning (ML) and develop the first set of techniques
for supervised learning. We will explore key ML concepts, including supervised classification,
linear regression, and principal component analysis, with a focus on ML considerations and
evaluation in life science applications.

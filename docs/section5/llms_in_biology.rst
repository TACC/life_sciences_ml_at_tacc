LLMs in Biology Applications
============================

Here we go over hands-on examples of how Large Language Models (LLMs) are being
used in life sciences computing applications. The examples are driven by current
topics found in the literature. By the end of this section, you should be able to:

* Learning Objective 1
* Learning Objective 2
* Learning Objective 3


Example 1: Protein Design
